# StutterSpeak

## Description
 Stutter Speak is a VR application intended to help stutterers improve their confidence through public speaking. By putting users in front of a digital audienc and giving them the ability to track their stutters and rate themselves in different categories, we are able to provide graphical data on their improvement over time. Stutter Speak focuses on improving ones image of their speaking, rather than improving the speaking itself, which is an important facet in the stuttering community. We hope that Stutter Speak has a positive influence on the stuttering community
 
## Development Process
In late May, the team conceived the idea and brought a proposal to a medical professional and licensed speech pathologist in order to bring her and her expertise on board. After acquiring her sponsorship, the team  moved on to the development stage. Developed in Unreal Engine 4, using a mixture of C++ and Blueprint, Stutter Speak went from concept to a full application in just under three months (May - August 2021). All code, assets, etc. were created in house aside from certain assets such as the sound effects, music, and the logo. 

## Release Channels
Stutter Speak is available through the Oculus App Lab platform on Oculus Quest 2 devices. It can be found by searching 'Stutter Speak' in the oculus store.
